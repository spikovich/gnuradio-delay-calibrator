# GNU Radio Delay Calibrator Code of Conduct

## Our Signal & Spectrum Philosophy

In the world of radio signals, every frequency has its place and purpose. Similarly, in our community, every voice matters. We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to create a collaborative environment that's as clean and interference-free as a perfectly calibrated radio spectrum.

Just as we work to eliminate delay and synchronization issues in radio flowgraphs, we strive to eliminate barriers to participation in our community regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

## Our Transmission Standards

To maintain a strong signal-to-noise ratio in our community:

### ðŸ“¡ Positive Transmissions
* **Amplify good signals:** Demonstrate empathy and kindness toward others
* **Fine-tune your feedback:** Provide and accept constructive criticism gracefully
* **Maintain phase coherence:** Respect differing viewpoints and experiences
* **Calibrate mistakes:** Accept responsibility when wrong and learn from experience
* **Optimize for all receivers:** Focus on what benefits the entire community

### ðŸš« Interference Patterns to Avoid
* **No signal jamming:** Harassment, trolling, or insulting/derogatory comments
* **No unauthorized broadcasts:** Publishing others' private information without permission
* **No harmful modulation:** Sexualized language or unwelcome attention
* **No spectrum pollution:** Public or private harassment
* **No out-of-band emissions:** Other conduct inappropriate in a professional setting

## Moderation Authority

Our community maintainers are responsible for clarifying these standards and taking appropriate corrective action against unacceptable behavior. They have the right to remove, edit, or reject contributions that don't align with this Code of Conduct.
